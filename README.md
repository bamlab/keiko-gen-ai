# Welcome to the GenAI Keiko

## The packages

### [Ai-scratch](packages/ai-scratch/README.md)

This is your playground/scratchpad. You will do the AI coding here.


### [Starting-app](packages/starting-app/README.md)

This is a open source app I found on the [bamlab](https://github.com/bamlab) git organization. I will use it as a starting point for the project. Your goal will be to migrate this React-Native app into a NextJS app.


### [Final-app](packages/final-app/README.md)

This is the final app. It is freshly created with `npx create-next-app@latest`.
